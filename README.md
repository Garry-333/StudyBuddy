# ðŸ“š StudyBuddy â€“ Smart Study Group Matching for Students

**StudyBuddy** is a platform designed to help university students form effective and lasting study groups based on the **exact combination of courses**, **degree program**, **language preference**, and **study goals**.

---

## Problem Statement

Students often want to study in groups, but face real and frustrating challenges:

- It's difficult to find others with the **same combination of courses** in a given semester.
- Degree programs like _BSc Informatik_ and _BSc Data Science & AI_ might share modules temporarily, but **diverge later**, breaking long-term study partnerships.
- **Time constraints** and inconsistent schedules make it hard to find overlapping availability with multiple students.
- **Language preferences** (English vs. German) and mismatched **study goals** lead to ineffective group dynamics.
- Existing tools like WhatsApp groups, Forums, or Telegram chats are **unstructured** and chaotic, not built for matching or managing study groups.

## Goals

StudyBuddy aims to solve these problems by:

- Matching students based on their **current semester course combination**
- Considering **degree programs** to avoid short-term compatibility mismatches
- Including **language preferences** for smoother collaboration
- Factoring in **study goals** (e.g., exam-focused vs. deep learning)
- Capturing studentsâ€™ **weekly availability** for easier group coordination
- Allowing students to update their profile as courses or schedules change
